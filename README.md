# Password Validator
A simple javascript program to make sure that a password is complex so that it cannot be easily guessed.

We are going to write a program to make sure that a password is complex so that it cannot be easily guessed. Our password validator will check multiple aspects of a potential password and will report back to the user if their password meets a set of rules.

The **rules** for our password validator are:

- Has at least **one uppercase** letter
- Has at least **one lowercase** letter
- Must be **8-20 characters long**
- Has at least **one special character**
